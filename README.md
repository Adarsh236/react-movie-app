### Application should contain the below features

  - Search
  - Clicking on a particular movie will redirect you to the selected &#39;movie detail&#39; page
- **Movie detail**
  - Show selected movie detail information
  - Navigate back to &#39;movie list&#39;

#### Pages should have proper urls and navigation should work as expected:

- using the back and forward button of the browser should take to the correct page
- reloading the current page should work as expected

#### Technologies required

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) (16.9 or higher)
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Scss](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) application state management.

You may use any 3rd party libraries which can facilitate your development.

- Application must contain at least one functional component utilizing hooks - [ReactJS Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- Application must contain at least one class component

#### Extra Credit

- use [Rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)
- Filter by Genre
- Unit tests

- Animations

If you get the demo in good shape and have extra time, add your own flair and features.

#### Content

- Together with this readme file, you will find `**content**` folder which contains helpful content for your application
  - Movies mock data
  - Movies cover images
- Feel free to modify movies content
- Feel free to modify movies model file

#### How to start?

We recommend starting the project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but you can use any other
skeleton or starter project.

#### Deliverable

- Provide a working application
- Provide source code in a public Git, Stash or Bitbucket repository
- Provide markdown readme file
  - General information about the app
  - Provide steps how to build/launch your application

Good luck!
